This is a machine learning model i have developed to detect cracks in images.

I have used Pytorch and Tensorflow to develop this model.

Pytorch model is in pt_model.py

Tensorflow model is in tf_model.py

# Note 
I have not personally tested the python files but i have extracted the functions from the .ipynb file i have been using on google colab.
But most probably the functions should work as expected.

But i am going to test them in no time.

Thank you for your patience.

# How to use the model

1. Clone the repository
2. The files include all the functions to train the model and also to test the model.
3. To train the model run the train.py file with the appropriate arguments.
4. To test the model run the test.py file with the appropriate arguments.
