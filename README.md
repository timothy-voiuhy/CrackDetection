This is a machine learning model i have developed to detect cracks in images.

I have used Pytorch and Tensorflow to develop this model.

Pytorch model is in pt_model.py

Tensorflow model is in tf_model.py

# How to use the model

1. Clone the repository
2. The files include all the functions to train the model and also to test the model.
3. To train the model run the train.py file with the appropriate arguments.
4. To test the model run the test.py file with the appropriate arguments.

# How to contribute

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Make the changes
4. Create a pull request
